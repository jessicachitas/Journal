# Tuesday 20/02/’18

* In the morning, we finished off tasks that were given to us the previous day. (Editing a Git file and pushing it back up)
* We then joined our supervisors and Ciaran to do the Marshmallow Challenge. (Our team didn’t win unfortunately but we did get to eat marshmallows haha)
* We then got an introduction to JavaScript from Dimitra and Ciaran and we learned about variables, conditions, data types, for loops functions and raises.
* We were then given a challenge to create a function that takes an array of variables and prints them. If there is an even number of them, they all print out but if there is an odd amount, it should print out a sad message.
* We worked on that challenge for a good amount of time but it was quite challenging at first (hence the name haha) but along with Dimitra’s and Ciaran’s help, we finally got through the end of it!
* They then gave us another challenge where, using JavaScript, we had to find the largest number out of an array (which again was challenging) but we got it working in the end!

**_Thoughts on JavaScript?_**

To be honest, it was quite difficult and confusing at the start but with further explanation from everyone that helped us, it definitely made much more sense as time went on and I now have a better understanding of the language.
