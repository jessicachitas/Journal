#Tuesday 27/02/â€™18

* In the morning, we worked on our PowToon and finished off any tasks from yesterday.
* We then attended a stand up with Judy and Mark and they told us a little bit about the Ops team and what they do.
* We got a little talk from Laura and Jameel about objects and we put them into everyday examples so we could understand them more. 
* We then got a talk from Judy and she gave us an introduction on cryptography and computer security. She also taught us how binary works and she gave us codes to crack using Caesar Cipher and Vigenere Cipher.
* We then got a talk from Jameel about .JSON and objects and how that that part of code would contribute to our timetable app.
* We then got to work on our timetable app and start step 4 of it. While we were working on it, Laura came over to help us if we got stuck on anything.
