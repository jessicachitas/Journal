# Friday 23/02/’18

* In the morning, we worked on the calculator from the previous day.
* We then set up breakfast in the canteen with Aoife and had some ourselves!
* We then went back to our workstation and worked more on the calculator.
* Dimitra then gave us a little talk on markdown and how to implement it in our journals.
* After our lunch, we helped Aoife set up the board room for their year in review that they do every February.
* We then attended said review and I still can’t believe that 120kg of Kit-Kats were eaten all of last year!
* After the year in review, we had a retrospective with Laura, Jameel, Dimitra and Judy where we talked about what went well during the week, what didn’t go well, what we wanted to do more of, our general thoughts about the work experience so far and what we would like to do next week.

**_How was the first week?_**

The first week was so so fun! There are so many lovely people here and they make the experience so enjoyable! We did so much this week and I’m really looking forward to next week!
