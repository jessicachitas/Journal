# Wednesday 21/02/â€™18

* In the morning, we finished off tasks from Tuesday and we partook in a stand up which Jameel invited us to.
* Then Jameel gave us a task to complete a number guessing game. That also took a while to complete haha.
* After lunch, we had a sound engineering session with Wojciech for about 2 hours where we recorded a small clip using keyboards and synthesizers.
* We then went back to our working space and continued with our really buggy (at the time) number guessing game haha!

Here's the code for the largest number in an array challenge:

```

var array = [2, 1, 3, 5]
var current = 0
var largest = 0

function printLargest(array)
{
    for (var counter = 0; counter < array.length; counter++)
    { 
     current = array[counter]
       if (current > largest) 
       {
           largest = current
       }
    } console.log(largest);
}
printLargest(array)

```
