* In the morning, we finished off tasks from Tuesday and we partook in a stand up which Jameel invited us to.
* Then Jameel gave us a task to complete a number guessing game. That also took a while to complete haha.
* After lunch, we had a sound engineering session with Wojciech for about 2 hours where we recorded a small clip using keyboards and synthesizers.
* We then went back to our working space and continued with our really buggy (at the time) number guessing game haha!
