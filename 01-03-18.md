# Thursday 01/03/’18

* We continued to work on the app and, with the help of the girls, we got a public and private key so we could git clone the app’s code to our desktop.
* We had a session with Ciaran and Dimitra about Semantic UI and how its really good to use when creating a HTML page.
* We then had a talk with Damien about career options in IT. I didn’t even realise how many job opportunities there were in IT!
* We had a chat with Brid about UI/UX design and she showed us what she does on a day to day basis.
* We then worked on the timetable app, searched for bugs in it, redesigned it and completed it! (Finally!)
