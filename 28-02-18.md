# Wednesday 28/02/’18

* We worked from home because there was tons of snow and we couldn’t get to the office.
* In the morning, I worked on my PowToon and journal while Robyn worked on the app.
* We when went back to fixing the timetable app. 
* We built the app and we were able to get it on our phones using a QR code scanner! (sadly, there were still some bugs that need some fixing… :( )
* We then had a Blue Jeans call with Judy, Laura and Jameel about the app and we were able to share our screen to show everyone what we were doing.
