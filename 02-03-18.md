# Friday 02/03/â€™18

* We worked on our PowToon in the morning.
* We then had a talk with Judy about AWS and she showed us how to make a virtual machine using AWS and NginX.
* We then continued finishing uncompleted tasks.
* We then presented our projects to Judy, Jameel, Ciaran, Laura and Dimitra via Blue Jeans.
