# Monday 19/02/’18

* We were introduced to our buddies/supervisors Jameel, Dimitra, Laura and Judy and got our laptops that we would be working on for the next 2 weeks.
* We then got a tour of the offices from Aoife. We saw the canteen, where everyone works and  other facilities housed in the building (pool table room, treadmill, etc.)
* We got a talk from Lee about the rules and regulations of RedHat and what we would like to get out of this work experience. 
* We then had our lunch and asked a few people about their jobs and what they do at Red Hat.
* We then got a crash course on HTML and CSS from Jameel and Dimitra and started to work on a Cordova app of our school timetable.
* We then got an introduction to GitHub from Laura and we made a directory, staged a file, committed a file and then pushed a file.

**_First thoughts?_**
There is such a friendly and welcoming environment in Red Hat and all the people here are super friendly and kind. Personally, I wasn’t expecting us to do a lot of things in the first day and I didn’t know that we were going to have a schedule either so it’s really great here so far! :)
