# Thursday 22/02/’18

* We finished off what we did yesterday and finally found the bug in our game!
* We then got a talk from Damien about the development process of software and the steps that are taken to get to the final stage of when a program is complete.
* After that, we went out to the reception with Aoife and she showed us invoicing using Oracle. We even got the chance to do some invoices ourselves which was super cool! (Even though I was so scared that I would mess up somewhere but I didn’t which was great haha!)
* After lunch, we attended a stand up with Laura and we talked a little about our guessing game.
* Then Judy gave us a little crash course in PowToon and how to make a presentation (which we will be using to create our final presentation)
* We then did more programming fundamentals where we started to create a calculator using HTML (and a little bit of JavaScript (it’s everywhere haha))
* We then attended a meeting about the Red Hat Women in Tech stand that will be at the WIT Arena on March 8th and we contributed to the meeting with a few ideas. (Mine being the binary race haha!)
* We then went back to our computers and finished off some work such as tweaking the calculator and finishing up the journal.

 Here is the code for the game:

``` 

// 1. Declare the secret value
var guess = 4
var count = 3

// 2. Have a user imput a value & 3. Tell user if this is higher/lower/equal to that secret value.
function printNumber(guess) {
    while(count > 0 && guess != line){
        var line = window.prompt("Guess a Number...");
        console.log(line);

        if (line == guess) {
            window.alert("correct!");
            count = 0
        }
        else{
            window.alert("incorrect, try again :(");
            count--
        } 
    }
} 
printNumber(guess)

```
